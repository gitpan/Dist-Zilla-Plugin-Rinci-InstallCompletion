NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Rinci::InstallCompletion - Install bash completion
    for scripts when distribution is installed

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.03 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Rinci::InstallCompletion (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Rinci-InstallCompletion), released on 2014-11-13.

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

     [Rinci::InstallCompletion]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin modifies "Makefile.PL" so that when a user installs your
    distribution with "make install", bash-completion-prog is invoked to add
    "complete" bash command for your scripts. This is convenient because at
    the next shell the user starts, bash tab completion is already activated
    for your scripts.

    bash-completion-prog recognizes several ways/hints to add completion to
    your scripts. Please see its documentation for more details.

    Some notes:

    First, user must already install and setup bash-completion-progs
    (included in App::BashCompletionProg distribution). But if
    App::BashCompletionProg is installed after your distribution is
    installed, she can simply run "bash-completion-prog" to scan PATH and
    add completion for all recognized scripts, including yours.

    Second, this plugin's implementation strategy is currently as follow
    (probably hackish): insert some code in the generated "Makefile.PL"
    after "WriteMakefile()" to insert some targets in the "Makefile"
    generated by "Makefile.PL".

    Third, currently only MakeMaker is supported, Module::Build is not.

SEE ALSO
    App::BashCompletionProg

    CLI scripts using the Perinci::CmdLine framework will automatically have
    bash completion capability. bash-completion-prog detects this.

    You can also use Getopt::Long::Complete.

    Or, if your CLI scripts use Getopt::Long, you can use
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenBashCompletion::GetoptLong to produce a
    completion script based on the spec passed in Getopt::Long::GetOptions.
