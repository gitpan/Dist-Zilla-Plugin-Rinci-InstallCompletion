NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Rinci::InstallCompletion - Install bash completion
    for scripts when distribution is installed

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Rinci::InstallCompletion (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Rinci-InstallCompletion), released on 2014-11-08.

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

     [Rinci::InstallCompletion]

DESCRIPTION
    If your command-line scripts uses Perinci::CmdLine (or its variant
    Perinci::CmdLine::Lite or Perinci::CmdLine::Any), you can use this
    plugin so that when a user installs your distribution with "make
    install", bash-completion-prog is invoked to add "complete" bash command
    for your scripts. This is convenient because at the next shell they
    start, bash tab completion is already activated for your scripts.

    Some notes:

    User must already install App::BashCompletionProg to manage their
    completion scripts in "~/.bash-completion-prog" (or
    "/etc/bash-completion-prog") and already call/source this file in their
    bash startup shell. (But if App::BashCompletionProg is installed after
    your distribution is installed, user can simply run
    "bash-completion-prog" to scan PATH and add completion for all
    Perinci::CmdLine-based scripts, including yours.)

    This plugin's implementation strategy is currently as follow (probably
    hackish): insert some code in the generated "Makefile.PL" after
    "WriteMakefile()" to insert some targets in the "Makefile" generated by
    "Makefile.PL".

    Currently only MakeMaker is supported, Module::Build is not.
